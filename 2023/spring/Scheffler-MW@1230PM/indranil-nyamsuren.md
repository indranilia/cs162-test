### Mongolian
I am a proud Mongolian by birth and a global citizen by choice. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in **Computer Science and Psychology** studying the crossings of technology and education. Throughout my studies, I have contributed to education initiatives in SF, Seoul, and Berlin. 

Before coming to Minerva, I worked for 3 years with 400+ Mongolian high school students, creating and leading courses on writing, project management, self-development, and more. I have a knack for coordinating and writing, a passion for education and community development, and a dream to positively impact the world.

I love challenging myself to *learn new things*! Currently I am learning:
- Chess
- Mongolian history
- History of computation :D
